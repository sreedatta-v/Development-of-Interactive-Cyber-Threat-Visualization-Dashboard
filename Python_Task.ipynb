        "1.  **Method Overriding**: As seen in inheritance, a subclass can provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",

        "*   **Method Overriding**: No special syntax beyond defining a method with the same name and signature in the child class as in the parent class.\n",
        "*   **Operator Overloading**: Python achieves operator overloading through special methods (also called \"magic\" or \"dunder\" methods) that begin and end with double underscores (e.g., `__add__` for `+`, `__len__` for `len()`, `__str__` for `str()`). By implementing these methods in your class, you define how your objects should behave when standard operators or functions are applied to them."
