# Development-of-Interactive-Cyber-Threat-Visualization-Dashboard

<h3> Project Statement: </h3>
<p> This project features an interactive, data-driven dashboard designed to streamline threat intelligence for cybersecurity analysts. By aggregating simulated security data—including CVE feeds and attack logs—the platform visualizes real-time attack patterns, temporal trends, and geographical hotspots. The goal is to transform raw security telemetry into actionable insights, enabling teams to prioritize resource allocation and strengthen their overall security posture through proactive risk mitigation. </p>
